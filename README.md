# Block_Cache_Buffer
Multi Threaded Cache 

This is a program that simulates a multi-threaded cache system in c++

Deffinitions for The Disk, Cache, and Block objects are in the same file as the main driver.
I am currently working to seperate them into seperate files to allow for better readability.

compile with g++ block_cache_buffer.cpp -std=c++11 -pthread
